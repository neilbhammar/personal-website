        <p className="text-gray-700">
          You're getting actual shares of the company, not just options. They're usually subject to vesting, which means they unlock over time.
        </p>
        
        <div className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 space-y-3">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Typical vesting:</strong> 4 years with a 1-year cliff. You get nothing if you leave before 1 year, then 25% of your shares unlock after year 1, and the rest unlock monthly over 3 years.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>The cliff:</strong> It's designed to make sure you stick around for at least a year before getting anything.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Without 83(b): The expensive problem</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          If you don't file the 83(b) election, you'll pay ordinary income tax every time your shares vest, based on the fair market value at that time.
        </p>
        
        <div className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 space-y-3">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>How fair market value works:</strong> It's usually determined by a 409A valuation (an accounting formula), which is typically around a quarter of the VC valuation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>The issue:</strong> As the company grows over 4 years, your shares might be worth $5 each by year 3. If you vest 10,000 shares that month, you're getting taxed on $50,000 of "income" - money you don't actually have in cash.
          </p>
        </div>

            <p><strong>Year 4:</strong> 25,000 shares vest at $15/share = $375,000 ordinary income tax</p>

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Without QSBS benefits, when the company sells (let's say 5 years later), you'll pay capital gains tax on the sale:

            <strong>Shares held more than a year:</strong> Long-term capital gains tax (better, but still significant)
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Shares vested within the last year:</strong> Short-term capital gains tax (equivalent to ordinary income tax - ouch)

      {/* With 83(b) - the solution */}
      <section className="space-y-4">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">With 83(b): Much better</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Filing the 83(b) election lets you pay taxes on all your shares upfront when the fair market value is super low, and starts your holding period immediately.
        </p>
        
        <div className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 space-y-3">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>You pay taxes upfront:</strong> When the company's just starting, fair market value might be a tenth or hundredth of a cent. Even if you own millions of shares, the tax bill will be pretty low.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Your holding period starts immediately:</strong> Instead of waiting for each tranche to vest, you start the clock on long-term capital gains and QSBS right away.

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Filing the 83(b) election also starts your QSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock) holding period immediately. If the company meets certain criteria (under $75M in assets when you got shares, C-corp, etc.), you could pay zero federal taxes when you sell.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              <strong>Step 1:</strong> Check your grant date. Do you still have time to file 83(b)? You have exactly 30 days.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4">
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              <strong>Step 2:</strong> File the 83(b) election immediately. Don't wait - there's no downside to filing early.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4">
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              <strong>Step 3:</strong> Ask your company for the current 409A valuation so you know what fair market value you'll be taxed on.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4">
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              <strong>Step 4:</strong> Keep all your paperwork. You'll need proof you filed when you eventually sell.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-6">
          Filing an 83(b) election is important because you want to start that QSBS clock as early as possible and avoid unforeseen tax events as you vest. Most people would rather pay a tiny amount (or almost nothing) upfront than get hit with massive tax bills later.
