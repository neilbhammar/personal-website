# Neil Bhammar's Personal Website

A minimalist personal website featuring interactive animations and smooth transitions. Originally prototyped on Replit and now migrated to a standalone repository for better performance and maintainability. I don't know how to code, so this was my first crack at deploying something _outside_ of replit (it was a ngihtmare).
